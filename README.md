# Julie-JS-Project33-Calorie-Tracker

This is the original version of the Calorie Tracker in Section 12 of the Traversy Media course, Modern JavaScript From the Beginning.  I wrote code along with Brad and troubleshooted bugs in my code on my own.  I also applied shorthand when naming and building functions.
